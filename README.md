# Performant Programming: Fractal GUI

Explore the mesmerizing world of fractals with our Performant Programming Fractal GUI. This Python-based project focuses on generating and visualizing the Mandelbrot set, employing PySide2 for the graphical user interface. Dive into the intricacies of fractal geometry through an interactive and performant application.

## Features

- **Dynamic Fractal Generation**: Utilizes Python to dynamically generate the Mandelbrot set, offering users a deep dive into fractal geometry.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with PySide2, the GUI (`fracviz.ui`) allows for real-time interaction, letting users adjust parameters like zoom and iteration depth for personalized fractal exploration.
- **Optimized Performance**: Incorporates multiprocessing to enhance fractal calculation speeds, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Comes with detailed documentation (`Ex4 - Fractal GUI.pdf` and `Ex4 - Fractal GUI_update.pdf`) to guide users through the application's functionality and underlying concepts.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Includes `wsl.py` for compatibility with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), broadening the application's usability across different environments.
